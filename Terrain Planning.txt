Terrain Class
	Holds the tileset for levels (current and ones being loaded)
		Will likely need to be a two-dimensional array (or other List-type) to hold tiles
		Origin will likely be the upper left, which is default for rendering applications
	Procedural generation will likely occur here in the future as well
	Grid functionality will likely need to occur here as well
	
	
Tile Class
	Each tile will need an object
		Should hold type, specify texture to load, and any info on it
		Should have an origin for sprites to snap to
		Will need a refresh or redraw flag/function to indicate changing status
