Terrain Class
	Holds the tileset for levels (current and ones being loaded)
		Will likely need a list of Vector2's to hold tile locations
		Origin will likely be the upper left, which is default for rendering applications
	Procedural generation will likely occur here in the future as well
		Will need some kind of pathfinding implemented to avoid making levels that cannot be completed
	Grid functionality will likely need to occur here as well
	
	
Tile Class
	Each tile will need an object
		Should hold type, specify texture to load, and any info on it
		Should have an origin for sprites to snap to
		Will need a refresh or redraw flag/function to indicate changing status
			Should likely just be handled by changing textures and the normal game Update() function
	Instead of making textures for base floor tiles like dirt, we might just have the game procedurally generate the tile art pixel-by-pixel
		Various shades of brown, some grey for little rocks/pebbles/etc
	Tile size needs to be determined
		64x64 with entities/gameobjects being 48x48 so you can see the floor beneath it?
