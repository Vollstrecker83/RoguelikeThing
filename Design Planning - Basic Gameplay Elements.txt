	Armor mitigates a certain amount of incoming damage, percentage based
	Also armor imposes a dodge penalty or maximum DEX benefit the heavier it is
	Armor should take into account the size of the opponent
		Larger monsters do more damage through armor, smaller ones do less, etc (a shield won't fully mitigate a dragon swipe)

	Armor protection against damage types and different 
	Inventory system
