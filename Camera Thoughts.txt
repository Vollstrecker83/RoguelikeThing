Camera:

	Top-Down view
	Can make it rotatable if we want, looks like it'd be a joke to implement
	Options to zoom in/out
		Should make a button that will return to normal zoom/rotation
	Button to lock/unlock camera like in LoL
	Also want to make the camera snap to whichever entity is actively moving while in combat, like Fallout

Graphics:
	When you're in combat, I want to highlight enemies in red. Neutral entities (if they exist) in yellow, same with doors.
	Some manner of graphics overlay for when you're in some kind of special state like sneaking, etc
